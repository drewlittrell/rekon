# @rekon/kernel-repo-model

Public repository model artifact contracts for Rekon.

## Stability

Label: `experimental, public`.

Symbols not re-exported from the package root are `internal`. See
[docs/concepts/stability.md](../../docs/concepts/stability.md).

## Purpose

This package owns deterministic model artifacts derived from evidence:

- `ObservedRepo`
- `ObservedSystem`
- `OwnershipMap`
- `CapabilityMap`
- `SemanticDebtJudgmentReport`

## Lifecycle Fit

Model artifacts are produced during `Project` and consumed by resolvers,
policy, docs, and intent/work-order generation.

## Public Surface

The package also exports validation helpers and normalization helpers for
systems and paths. Semantic debt report policy records provider, model, effort,
and prompt version so cached judgments retain their execution provenance.

## Import Boundary

These are projections, not canonical input truth. They must point back to evidence with `ArtifactRef`s.
