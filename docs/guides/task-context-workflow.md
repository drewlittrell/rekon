# Task Context Workflow

This guide turns the [TaskContextReport Workflow Integration
Decision](../strategy/task-context-report-workflow-integration-decision.md)
(Option B — context-first workflow policy) into a practical habit for humans and
agents. TaskContextReport is the standard pre-work context substrate, not a proof
artifact.

## What This Is

`rekon context task` builds one `TaskContextReport` for a task and presents it two
ways: a human "read this before editing" markdown brief and a structured
`agentContext` JSON block. This guide explains **when** to build that context and
**how** each reader should use it — before planning or editing, not as approval.

Context-first means context before planning or editing, not context as approval.
The report orients work; it never decides, approves, or executes anything.

## Context-First Workflow

The standard Rekon workflow is **context first, plan second, approval third,
handoff fourth**:

1. **Build / refresh evidence** — make sure the capability graph (and optionally
   semantic / embedding evidence) reflects the current repo.
2. **Build task context** — run `rekon context task` for the task you are about to
   work on.
3. **Human reads the markdown brief** — orient before touching code.
4. **Agent reads the `agentContext` JSON** — exact paths, constraints, hints,
   warnings, evidence, boundaries.
5. **Optionally pass the report to intent** — `rekon intent assess` /
   `rekon intent plan review` accept it explicitly via `--task-context-ref`.
6. **Prepare / approve / status / handoff stay separate** — none are unlocked by
   context.

| Step | Command / Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| build evidence | `rekon scan` / `rekon capability graph build` | evidence substrate |
| build context | `rekon context task` | task-shaped context |
| human read | markdown view | orientation |
| agent read | `agentContext` JSON | structured guidance |
| intent assess | `--task-context-ref` | optional explicit context |
| plan review | `--task-context-ref` | optional explicit context |
| prepare / approve / handoff | separate commands | separate gates |

## Command Sequence

The canonical pre-work sequence:

```bash
rekon scan

rekon capability graph build

rekon context task \
  --task "Describe the change" \
  --path src/example.ts \
  --json

TASK_REF="$(rekon artifacts latest --type TaskContextReport --id-only)"

rekon intent assess \
  --goal "Describe the change" \
  --path src/example.ts \
  --task-context-ref "$TASK_REF" \
  --json

rekon intent plan review \
  --plan plans/change.md \
  --goal "Describe the change" \
  --task-context-ref "$TASK_REF" \
  --json
```

`rekon artifacts latest --type TaskContextReport --id-only` resolves the most
recent report's id (add `--allow-missing` to tolerate a fresh repo). The intent
steps are **optional** — context is useful on its own for a human or agent about
to edit.

## Human Reading Guide

Humans should read the TaskContextReport markdown before editing. The brief opens
with "Read this before editing." and renders:

- **Core Context** — operator paths and deterministic graph facts (the context
  that outranks similarity).
- **Related / Supporting Context** — embedding/semantic neighbors as proposal-grade
  support.
- **Do Not Touch** — zones tagged "(guidance, not enforced)".
- **Verification Hints** — checks tagged "(hint, not executed)".
- **Warnings** — context-quality notes (e.g. retrieval unavailable, low signal).
- **Evidence** — the deduped, sorted evidence refs behind the context.

Treat do-not-touch zones as strong guidance, verification hints as suggested
checks (not executed proof), warnings as context-quality notes, and evidence refs
as traceability back to graph claims / embedding chunks.

## Agent Consumption Guide

Agents should consume agentContext before editing. Prefer the exact paths and
symbols in `coreContext`; treat `supportingContext` as useful but lower priority;
obey `doNotTouch` guidance unless the operator explicitly overrides it; treat
`verificationHints` as suggestions only. See
[Agent Context Instructions](agent-context-instructions.md) for the full agent
protocol.

| Consumer | Reads | Uses For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| human | markdown | orientation before editing |
| agent | agentContext JSON | exact paths / constraints / hints |
| intent assess | TaskContextReport ref | matchedContext enrichment |
| intent plan review | TaskContextReport ref | revision guidance |

## Intent Workflow Integration

`rekon intent assess` and `rekon intent plan review` accept a `TaskContextReport`
explicitly via `--task-context latest` / `--task-context-ref <ref>`. Used reports
enrich assessment `matchedContext` and plan-review `revisionPrompt` as additive
context — never readiness, never proof. They do **not** auto-generate context; you
pass it. `rekon intent prepare` does not take a task-context flag — it receives
context only by lineage through the assessment / actionability artifacts. Prepare /
approve / status / handoff remain separately gated. TaskContextReport consumption
remains explicit unless a future decision changes it.

## Optional Evidence Enrichment

Context quality improves when the underlying evidence is richer, but none of these
are required:

```bash
rekon scan --semantic-files auto
rekon capability graph build --semantic-file-reports latest
rekon embeddings index --changed
```

Without them, `context task` still builds from the deterministic graph and explicit
`--path` inputs (and degrades to a graph + lexical fallback when an implicitly
defaulted embedding provider has no key). Regenerate context after the repo
changes materially so the brief reflects the current source.

## Boundaries

- TaskContextReport is the standard pre-work context substrate, not a proof artifact.
- Context-first means context before planning or editing, not context as approval.
- Humans should read the TaskContextReport markdown before editing.
- Agents should consume agentContext before editing.
- TaskContextReport must not approve plans.
- TaskContextReport must not execute commands.
- TaskContextReport must not write source files.
- TaskContextReport must not create WorkOrder or VerificationPlan.
- Verification hints remain hints, not executed commands.
- Do-not-touch zones remain guidance/context, not enforcement.
- TaskContextReport consumption remains explicit unless a future decision changes it.
- Prepare / approve / status / handoff remain separately gated.
- TaskContextReport may be included in bundles only as optional context, not proof.
- intent:go remains deferred.

| Boundary | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| context vs proof | context only |
| context vs approval | no approval |
| context vs command execution | no execution |
| context vs source writes | no writes |
| context vs WorkOrder / VerificationPlan | not created |
| verification hints | hints only |
| do-not-touch zones | guidance/context |
| intent:go | deferred |

## What This Does Not Do

This guide adds no automation and changes no runtime behavior. Context is never
generated automatically inside intent commands, never becomes proof or approval,
never executes a verification hint or any target-repo command, never writes source,
never creates a WorkOrder or VerificationPlan, and never runs Circe. Do-not-touch
enforcement, required-context gating, bundle/handoff inclusion, and intent:go all
remain deferred.

> Update (slice 181 · TaskContextReport Workflow Guide Safety Review): the slice-180 workflow guide + agent instructions were reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — docs/product surface only, guidance not automation. Humans read the TaskContextReport markdown before editing; agents consume `agentContext` before editing; every documented command was confirmed against the live CLI. TaskContextReport stays context, not proof — no approval / command execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; consumption stays explicit; prepare / approve / status / handoff stay separately gated; bundle inclusion optional context only; intent:go deferred; the workflow guide introduces no runtime behavior changes. See [`task-context-workflow-guide-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-workflow-guide-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 182 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Decision): intent bundles may carry optional `TaskContextReport` refs as context for agents/operators (Option B + E) — an additive `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` section plus Rekon-side `context/` sidecars, with the Circe handoff schema unchanged in v1. Inclusion is optional, never required; context stays context, not proof — it must not approve plans, satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan gates, change phase gates, execute commands, write source, or run Circe; hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; Circe is not required to know TaskContextReport internals in v1; intent:go deferred. First implementation: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Implementation. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-decision.md).

> Update (slice 183 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Implementation): `rekon intent bundle write` now attaches optional `TaskContextReport` refs via a repeatable `--task-context-ref` (plus bounded lineage discovery from prepared-plan / assessment `inputRefs`) as an additive `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` section (`role: optional-agent-context`, `proof: false`) plus three Rekon-side `context/` sidecars (`task-context.md` / `task-context.agent.json` / `task-context.refs.json`). With no ref the bundle is byte-identical; a missing / wrong-type ref fails cleanly. The Circe handoff projection (`circe/handoff.json` etc.) and the WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase-gate files are unchanged and never carry task context. TaskContextReport may be included in bundles only as optional context, not proof — it must not be required to write an intent bundle, approve plans, satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan or phase gates, execute commands, write source, or run Circe; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch zones remain guidance; Circe handoff JSON is unchanged in v1; intent:go remains deferred. Implements the slice-182 decision (Option B + E). See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-implementation.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-implementation.md).

> Update (slice 184 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Safety Review): the slice-183 bundle-context implementation was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — optional `TaskContextReport` context in intent bundles holds every boundary. TaskContextReport may be included in bundles only as optional context, not proof, and is not required to write an intent bundle: a bundle with no ref is byte-identical; a bundle with a ref adds only `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` (`proof: false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) and the `context/` sidecars (`task-context.md` optional guidance not proof, `task-context.agent.json` all-false boundaries, `task-context.refs.json` refs + `proof:false`). The Circe handoff JSON is unchanged in v1; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase gates unchanged; missing + wrong-type refs fail cleanly; lineage discovery stays bounded and optional. No approval / command execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; verification hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; intent:go remains deferred. Recommended next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 185 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood): the optional bundle-context sidecars were dogfooded on a realistic operator/agent handoff path (full intent path → `intent bundle write --task-context-ref` → validate). bundle write succeeded; `manifest.context.taskContextReports` (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) was discoverable; the `context/task-context.md` human brief, `context/task-context.agent.json` agent view, and `context/task-context.refs.json` traceability index were all useful; bundle JSON reported the `taskContext` sidecars; the Circe handoff JSON remains unchanged / not dependent on task context; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates unchanged; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred. One narrow human-discoverability gap was fixed: the bundle `README.md` now renders an additive "## Task context" section (guidance, not proof) only when a TaskContextReport is attached. Sidecars are ready for broader handoff use. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-dogfood.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-dogfood.md).

> Update (slice 186 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood Safety Review): the slice-185 dogfood result + the narrow bundle-README discoverability fix were reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable. TaskContextReport bundle context is optional context, not proof; the full bundle-context dogfood path completed successfully; `manifest.context.taskContextReports` was discoverable (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`); the `context/task-context.md` / `.agent.json` / `.refs.json` sidecars were useful to humans, agents, and traceability; the bundle README now points to the sidecars (guidance, not proof) when context is attached and is omitted otherwise; Circe handoff JSON remains unchanged / not dependent on task context; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates unchanged; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred. Bundle context is ready for broader handoff use. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Broader Handoff Decision.

> Update (slice 187 · TaskContextReport Bundle Broader Handoff Decision): decided how broader operator/agent handoff workflows should use the optional bundle-context sidecars (Option B — promote them in human/agent handoff guidance, recommended not required). Humans should inspect `context/task-context.md` when present; agents should read `context/task-context.agent.json` when present; the follow-up will point `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md` (and optionally `agent/context.json` metadata) at the sidecars. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof — must not be required to write an intent bundle, approve plans, execute commands, write source, or satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan or phase gates; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch zones remain guidance; Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract and is not required to understand TaskContextReport internals; intent:go remains deferred. First implementation: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Implementation. See [`task-context-report-bundle-broader-handoff-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-broader-handoff-decision.md).

> Update (slice 188 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Implementation): when a `TaskContextReport` is attached to an intent plan bundle, the agent-facing bundle files now promote the optional context sidecars. `agent/instructions.md` and `agent/handoff.md` gain a "## Task context" section (only when a TaskContextReport is attached) pointing at `context/task-context.agent.json` / `context/task-context.md`, framing context as not-proof and keeping WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase gates authoritative; `agent/context.json` gains an additive `taskContext` metadata block (`available:true`, `proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) with every existing field preserved. With no task context the agent files are byte-identical. The bundle README section, the `context/` sidecars, and the Circe handoff trio are unchanged. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof — humans should inspect context/task-context.md when present; agents should read context/task-context.agent.json when present; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract; intent:go remains deferred. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-implementation.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-implementation.md).

> Update (slice 189 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Safety Review): the slice-188 agent-facing handoff guidance was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof; `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md` promote the optional task context only when sidecars are present; `agent/context.json` carries additive `taskContext` metadata (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) when present and preserves every existing field; without-context bundles are byte-identical. Agents should read `context/task-context.agent.json` when present; humans should inspect `context/task-context.md` when present; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates remain authoritative; the Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract and is not required to understand TaskContextReport internals; sidecars must not approve plans, execute commands, or write source; intent:go remains deferred. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 190 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood — rebased on 4cc34b73 Circe actor contracts): the promoted handoff guidance was re-dogfooded from both the human-operator and the agent perspective against the current bundle producer after `4cc34b73` ("feat: emit target-specific Circe actor contracts"). A human can discover task context from `README.md`; `context/task-context.md` + `context/task-context.refs.json` were useful; an agent can discover it from `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md`; `agent/context.json` `taskContext` metadata + `context/task-context.agent.json` were useful; `agent/verification.json` stayed authoritative for verification posture and `agent/source-refs.json` for source refs. The Circe handoff trio stayed stable and independent of TaskContextReport — `circe/handoff.json` now carries an additive `actorContracts` block. The new `circe/actor-contracts/` artifacts (3 contract Markdown + 3 JSON Schema, default `circe` target) were present and non-executing (return-shape guidance/artifacts, not executed workers) and identical in the without-context bundle. WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates remained authoritative; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred; the without-context bundle omitted every task-context surface. No fix needed. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-dogfood.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-dogfood.md).

> Update (slice 191 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood Safety Review): the shipped slice-190 handoff dogfood (`c5acc07`) — including the `circe/actor-contracts` surface and the new Circe Operator Command Boundary added in `11a209fd` — was reviewed end-to-end and declared **safe/stable** before broader handoff workflow use. Strategy/safety-review batch; no runtime/API/CLI/agent-file-rendering/actor-contract-generation/operator-boundary-generation/Circe-schema/gate change. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof; the full handoff dogfood path completed successfully; the human + agent task-context surfaces stay discoverable and non-authoritative; `agent/verification.json` + `agent/source-refs.json` stay authoritative; the Circe handoff JSON stays stable and independent of TaskContextReport; Circe actor-contract artifacts were present and non-executing (guidance/artifacts, not executed workers); the new Operator Command Boundary is operator-only inspection guidance, not worker execution guidance — it reinforces that Rekon does not run Circe and treats worker requests to run Circe operator commands as plan-quality concerns; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates remain authoritative; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred; the without-context bundle stayed clean.

> Update (slice 192 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Broader Workflow Decision): decided how broader operator/agent handoff workflows should use the bundle surfaces — **Option B, an explicit reading-order policy** — rebased onto `e91dc087` ("feat: classify phase source-change intent") to include the new per-phase source-change posture. Decision-only; no runtime/API/CLI/bundle/Circe-schema/gate change. Humans inspect `README.md` first, then `context/task-context.md` when present; agents inspect `agent/instructions.md` first, then `agent/handoff.md`, then `agent/context.json`, then `context/task-context.agent.json` when present. Four handoff layers: operator orientation; agent structured handoff; source/verification authority (WorkOrder, VerificationPlan, **phase source-change posture**, `agent/source-refs.json`, `agent/verification.json`); Circe contract layer. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof; phase source-change posture belongs to the authoritative source/verification layer, not the task-context layer — it is handoff evidence, not approval, and TaskContextReport sidecars must not override `sourceChange` posture; WorkOrder/VerificationPlan + phase gates + agent verification + source refs remain authoritative; Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract; actor contracts are role/return-shape guidance, not executed workers; the Operator Command Boundary stays operator-only; verification hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; intent:go deferred. First implementation: Intent Bundle Handoff Reading Order Implementation. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-broader-workflow-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-broader-workflow-decision.md).

> Update (slice 193 · Intent Bundle Handoff Reading Order Implementation): the intent plan bundle now promotes the handoff reading order directly in its surfaces — a "## Handoff reading order" section in `README.md` (human + agent lists), a "## Reading order" section in `agent/instructions.md` and `agent/handoff.md`, and an additive `handoffReadingOrder` metadata block in `agent/context.json`. Always rendered; task-context entries say "if present". Guidance only — no Circe handoff schema, actor-contract, source-change-classification, or gate change; TaskContextReport stays optional context, WorkOrder / VerificationPlan stay authoritative, source-change posture stays handoff evidence not approval, intent:go stays deferred. See [`intent-bundle-handoff-reading-order-implementation`](../strategy/intent-bundle-handoff-reading-order-implementation.md).

> Update (slice 194 · Intent Bundle Handoff Reading Order Safety Review): the slice-193 bundle handoff reading order was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — guidance, not automation. The README / agent-instructions / agent-handoff reading-order sections and the additive `agent/context.json.handoffReadingOrder` metadata (which preserves every existing field) guide humans and agents toward authoritative surfaces while every boundary holds: TaskContextReport sidecars stay optional context (not proof); WorkOrder / VerificationPlan stay authoritative; phase source-change posture stays handoff evidence, not approval; actor contracts stay role/return-shape guidance; the Operator Command Boundary stays operator-only; `circe/*` is byte-unchanged; intent:go deferred. See [`intent-bundle-handoff-reading-order-safety-review`](../strategy/intent-bundle-handoff-reading-order-safety-review.md).
