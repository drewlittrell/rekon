# PathFreshnessReport

## Purpose

`PathFreshnessReport` records a **deterministic
comparison between the current working-tree fingerprint
of a declared source-path set and a baseline fingerprint
captured by an earlier `PathFreshnessReport`.** It is
the first watcher / path-freshness slice — selected by
the
[Post-Beta Dogfood Evidence Triage Decision](../strategy/post-beta-dogfood-evidence-triage.md)
(Option C) and reserved by the
[Watcher / Path Freshness Policy Decision](../strategy/watcher-path-freshness-policy-decision.md).

The report exists so operators and agents can tell
**without running a daemon** whether the files Rekon's
artifacts cite have drifted since those artifacts were
generated. The recommendation field tells the operator
to run `rekon refresh` explicitly when the working tree
has changed.

## Distinction From Artifact Lineage Freshness

**Artifact lineage freshness is not working-tree
freshness.** The two are independent and both
matter:

- **Artifact lineage freshness** — handled by the
  runtime's `validateArtifactFreshness` and the
  existing `## Input Freshness Warnings` / `###
  Governance Freshness` surfaces. It flags drift
  *within* the artifact chain (e.g., the latest
  `FindingReport` no longer matches the snapshot it
  cites).
- **Working-tree freshness** — handled by
  `PathFreshnessReport`. It flags drift *between*
  the source files and the latest recorded
  source-state baseline.

Neither replaces the other; both can be `fresh` while
the other is `stale`.

## Status Of The Surface

**Shipped (this slice):**

- `PathFreshnessReport` artifact type registered in
  `@rekon/sdk` conformance + `@rekon/runtime`
  category map (`actions`).
- `createPathFreshnessReport(...)` + `comparePathFreshness(current,
  baseline?)` pure helpers in `@rekon/capability-intent`.
- `buildSourceStateFingerprint(input)` pure helper in
  `@rekon/kernel-repo-model` (sha256 hashes; default
  ignore set; deterministic root hash).
- `rekon paths freshness [--path <path>] [--root
  <path>] [--json]` CLI command that writes one
  `PathFreshnessReport` per invocation. **Read-only
  with respect to source files.**

**Shipped (follow-on slice
`path-freshness-publication-surfacing`):**

- Architecture summary renders a `## Working Tree
  Path Freshness` section.
- Agent contract renders a `### Working Tree Path
  Freshness` subsection + a new Do-Not-Do
  reminder.
- Proof report renders a `## Working Tree Path
  Freshness` section.
- All three publishers cite the latest
  `PathFreshnessReport` in `header.inputRefs` when
  present. **Publications are read-only with
  respect to the report: they never run `rekon
  paths freshness` and never run `rekon refresh`.**

**Shipped (follow-on slice
`path-freshness-github-review-surfacing`):**

- GitHub Check dry-run / send payload includes a
  compact `Working tree path freshness:` block in
  `output.summary` sourced from the latest
  `PathFreshnessReport`. The Check payload
  appends the report ref to `citedRefs`.
- PR comment dry-run / send body includes two new
  table rows (`Working-tree freshness` +
  `PathFreshnessReport`) sourced from the latest
  `PathFreshnessReport`. The comment's
  `### Warnings` section gains the stale or
  unknown warning. JSON output adds
  `citedRefs.pathFreshness` (additive only).
- **Both GitHub review surfaces read the latest
  `PathFreshnessReport` and never run `rekon
  refresh` or `rekon paths freshness`.**
- **Stale `PathFreshnessReport` is a trust
  warning — it is visible in the Check output and
  PR comment body but does not by itself flip the
  GitHub Check conclusion in this slice.**
  Conclusion continues to be derived from proof /
  validation state via the existing
  `pickConclusion` logic.
- **GitHub status / comments remain non-canonical;
  both surfaces retain their existing
  canonical-truth reminders.**

**Deferred (follow-on slices):**

- Path freshness safety review (next slice).
- Watcher daemon design + implementation.
- Source-write apply.

## Shape

```ts
export type PathFreshnessStatus = "fresh" | "stale" | "unknown";

export type PathFreshnessPathStatus =
  | "fresh"
  | "changed"
  | "missing"
  | "new"
  | "unknown";

export type SourcePathFingerprint = {
  path: string;
  hash?: string;
  size?: number;
  exists: boolean;
  /**
   * mtime is **advisory only** — never canonical
   * freshness evidence. Hash comparison is the
   * source of truth.
   */
  mtimeAdvisory?: string;
};

export type SourceStateFingerprint = {
  algorithm: "sha256";
  rootHash: string;
  paths: SourcePathFingerprint[];
  generatedAt: string;
  ignoredGlobs?: string[];
};

export type PathFreshnessEntry = {
  path: string;
  status: PathFreshnessPathStatus;
  currentHash?: string;
  baselineHash?: string;
  currentExists?: boolean;
  baselineExists?: boolean;
  message?: string;
};

export type PathFreshnessSummary = {
  total: number;
  fresh: number;
  changed: number;
  missing: number;
  new: number;
  unknown: number;
};

export type PathFreshnessRecommendation = {
  refreshRecommended: boolean;
  commands: string[]; // e.g. ["rekon refresh"]
  message: string;
};

export type PathFreshnessReport = {
  header: ArtifactHeader;
  status: PathFreshnessStatus;
  baselineRef?: ArtifactRef;
  baselineGeneratedAt?: string;
  currentSourceState: SourceStateFingerprint;
  baselineSourceState?: SourceStateFingerprint;
  entries: PathFreshnessEntry[];
  summary: PathFreshnessSummary;
  recommendation: PathFreshnessRecommendation;
};
```

`ArtifactHeader` is unchanged. The report records
hashes and path-level metadata only — **never raw file
contents.**

## Source-State Fingerprint

`buildSourceStateFingerprint(input)` walks the source
tree under `input.repoRoot`, hashes file contents with
sha256, and returns a deterministic
`SourceStateFingerprint`. Behaviour:

- **Deterministic ordering.** Paths are sorted
  lexically; `rootHash` is a sha256 over the
  canonical JSON of `{path, hash, size, exists}`
  entries.
- **Bounded.** Files larger than 32 MiB record
  `exists + size` only (no hash) so a runaway file
  never exhausts memory.
- **Default ignore set.** When the operator does
  not supply `paths`, the walk excludes any
  segment in the default set:
  `.git`, `.rekon`, `node_modules`, `dist`,
  `coverage`, `.next`, `.turbo`, `.cache`. The
  ignored set is recorded on the fingerprint for
  audit reviewers.
- **`mtimeAdvisory` only.** When
  `includeMtimeAdvisory: true` is passed (CLI
  defaults to `false`), the entry records the
  file's mtime as an **advisory** field. Hash
  comparison remains the canonical signal during
  `comparePathFreshness`; **mtimes are never
  canonical freshness evidence.**
- **No source mutation. No network.** The helper
  is strictly read-only and never opens a socket.

## Comparator Rules

`comparePathFreshness(current, baseline?)` is a pure
function that produces the report's `status` /
`entries` / `summary` / `recommendation`:

| Condition | Per-path status | Run status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline absent (first run) | every current path → `unknown` | `unknown` (with refreshRecommended = false; "No baseline" message) |
| Path in current + baseline, hashes equal | `fresh` | contributes to `fresh` |
| Path in current + baseline, hashes differ | `changed` | contributes to `stale` |
| Path in baseline but not current | `missing` | contributes to `stale` |
| Path in current but not baseline | `new` | contributes to `stale` |

Aggregate rule: if any entry is `changed`, `missing`,
or `new`, the report's overall `status` is `stale`;
otherwise `fresh`. The recommendation field tells the
operator to run `rekon refresh` when the report is
`stale`.

## CLI Surface

```bash
rekon paths freshness [--path <path>] [--path <path>] [--root <path>] [--json]
```

Behaviour:

- **Read-only with respect to source files.**
  Writes exactly one new `PathFreshnessReport`
  artifact under
  `.rekon/artifacts/actions/PathFreshnessReport-<id>.json`.
- Compares against the most recent prior
  `PathFreshnessReport` for the same workspace.
  When `--path` narrows the tracking set, the
  baseline comparison is narrowed to the same set
  so unrelated paths in the broader baseline do
  not surface noise.
- Prints a JSON or human summary; exits 0
  regardless of status (the report's `status` is
  the operator-facing signal, not the exit code).
- **Does NOT run `rekon refresh`.** Refresh
  remains operator-initiated, full stop.
- **Does NOT start a watcher daemon. No
  background refresh. No file-system event
  subscription.**

### Output (JSON)

```json
{
  "artifact": { "type": "PathFreshnessReport", "id": "..." },
  "status": "stale",
  "summary": { "total": 2, "fresh": 0, "changed": 1, "missing": 1, "new": 0, "unknown": 0 },
  "recommendation": {
    "refreshRecommended": true,
    "commands": ["rekon refresh"],
    "message": "Source paths changed since the last PathFreshnessReport. Run `rekon refresh` before relying on existing artifacts."
  },
  "entries": [ /* per-path */ ],
  "baselineRef": { "type": "PathFreshnessReport", "id": "..." }
}
```

### Output (human)

```
Path freshness: stale
Paths inspected: 2 (fresh 0, changed 1, missing 1, new 0, unknown 0)
Recommendation: Source paths changed since the last PathFreshnessReport. Run `rekon refresh` before relying on existing artifacts.
Commands: rekon refresh
Artifact: PathFreshnessReport:path-freshness-<timestamp>
```

## Safety Contract

- **No source writes.** The helper, the comparator,
  and the CLI never touch a source file.
- **No watcher daemon. No background refresh. No
  file-system event subscription.**
- **Hashes only — never file contents.** A
  `PathFreshnessReport` carries deterministic
  identifiers, not retrievable copies of source.
- **mtimes are advisory only — never canonical
  freshness evidence.** Hash comparison is the
  source of truth; mtimes exist as a debugging
  aid only.
- **Conservative default ignore set.** Build
  artefacts (`dist`, `coverage`, `.next`,
  `.turbo`, `.cache`), VCS metadata (`.git`), the
  package manager cache (`node_modules`), and
  Rekon's own workspace (`.rekon`) are excluded
  from the default walk so source-state churn is
  driven by intentional source changes only.
- **`PathFreshnessReport` is a projection, not
  truth.** It exists to inform operator decisions
  (run `rekon refresh`? trust the latest
  artifacts?) — not to silently re-derive
  anything.
