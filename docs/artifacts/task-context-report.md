# TaskContextReport

> **Broader-workflow role decided (slice 176):** TaskContextReport is the standard

`TaskContextReport` is a canonical, structured-JSON artifact that turns a concrete
task into a compact, explainable **context bundle**: deterministic graph facts,
embedding-retrieval neighbors, do-not-touch zones, and verification hints, each
with preserved evidence refs. The human/markdown view is a rendering of this
artifact.

**Task-shaped context is proposal/context, not proof.**

## Producer

- Builder: `buildTaskContextReport` (`@rekon/capability-model`) — a pure helper.
- CLI: `rekon context task --task <text> [--path <path>] [--provider voyage|mock]
  [--model <m>] [--top-k <n>] [--root <path>] [--json]`.
- Category: `actions`. Schema version: `0.1.0`.

## Shape

```ts
type TaskContextReport = {
  header: ArtifactHeader;          // artifactType "TaskContextReport"
  schemaVersion: "0.1.0";
  task: { text: string; paths: string[]; goal?: string };
  selection: {
    query: string;
    provider?: string;
    model?: string;
    topK: number;
    scoreBands: { strong: number; useful: number; weak: number; ignored: number };
  };
  contextItems: Array<{
    id: string;
    kind: "file" | "symbol" | "capability" | "semantic_summary"
        | "verification_hint" | "do_not_touch" | "risk";
    path?: string;
    symbolId?: string;
    capabilityId?: string;
    reason: string;                // every item carries a reason
    score?: number;
    scoreBand?: "strong" | "useful" | "weak" | "ignored";
    evidenceRefs: string[];        // preserved
    source: "deterministic_graph" | "semantic_file_understanding"
          | "embedding_retrieval" | "operator_input";
  }>;
  graphNeighborhood: { nodes: Array<{ kind: string; id: string }>; claims: string[] };
  doNotTouch: Array<{ reason: string; path?: string; symbolId?: string; evidenceRefs: string[] }>;
  verificationHints: Array<{ command?: string; artifact?: string; reason: string; evidenceRefs: string[] }>;
  summary: {
    contextItems: number; graphNodes: number; graphClaims: number;
    doNotTouch: number; verificationHints: number; embeddingNeighbors: number;
  };
  boundaries: {
    retrievalIsProof: false; approvedPlans: false; executedCommands: false;
    wroteSourceFiles: false; createdPreparedIntentPlan: false; createdWorkOrder: false;
    createdVerificationPlan: false; ranCirce: false; implementedIntentGo: false;
  };
};
```

## Rules

- The factory (`createTaskContextReport`) forces every `boundaries` field to
  `false` and recomputes `summary`.
- The validator (`validateTaskContextReport`) rejects any non-false boundary,
  empty task text, a context item missing a reason, and a mismatched summary.
- `evidenceRefs` reference graph evidence/claim ids and retrieval chunk ids.

## Selection

1. Operator-provided paths are high-priority context.
2. Strong and useful embedding neighbors are included; weak neighbors are
   optional/supporting; ignored neighbors are excluded by default.
3. Selected paths are expanded through `CapabilityEvidenceGraph`; deterministic
   facts are admitted even when the embedding score is lower.

## Boundaries

- **Task-shaped context is proposal/context, not proof.**
- **Embedding retrieval is proposal/context, not proof.**
- **CapabilityEvidenceGraph remains the evidence substrate.**
- **Deterministic graph facts outrank embedding similarity.**
- **Task context must not approve plans.**
- **Task context must not execute commands.**
- **Task context must not write source files.**
- **Task context must not create WorkOrder or VerificationPlan.**
- **Task context must not run Circe.**
- **Task context must preserve evidence refs.**
- **Verification hints are hints, not executed commands.**
- **Duplicate detection remains deferred.**
- **Canonical recommendations remain deferred.**
- **intent:go remains deferred.**

> Update (slice 177 · TaskContextReport Human/Agent Context Export): `rekon context task` now prints a human "read this before editing" brief (Core Context, Related / Supporting Context, Do Not Touch, Verification Hints, Evidence) and adds an additive `agentContext` block to its `--json` payload. Presentation only — the TaskContextReport artifact stays canonical, human markdown is a rendered view, agent JSON is the structured source of truth; every existing JSON field preserved; verification hints stay hints, do-not-touch stays guidance, evidence preserved; no approval / execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; intent:go deferred. See [`task-context-human-agent-export.md`](../strategy/task-context-human-agent-export.md).

> Update (slice 178 · TaskContextReport Human/Agent Export Safety Review): the slice-177 `rekon context task` human/agent export was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — presentation only. The TaskContextReport artifact is canonical, human markdown is a rendered view, agent JSON (`agentContext`) is the structured source of truth and is additive (every existing top-level JSON field preserved); verification hints stay hints (`executed:false`), do-not-touch zones stay guidance (`enforced:false`), evidence refs are preserved, boundaries stay all-false; no approval / command execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; intent:go deferred. See [`task-context-human-agent-export-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-human-agent-export-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 179 · TaskContextReport Workflow Integration Decision): the standard Rekon workflow is now context first, plan second, approval third, handoff fourth (Option B). `TaskContextReport` is the standard pre-work context substrate, not a proof artifact — recommended (not required, not automatic) before human/agent implementation and before `intent assess` / `intent plan review`; humans read the markdown brief, agents consume `agentContext`. Consumption stays explicit; `intent prepare` stays lineage-only; prepare / approve / status / handoff stay separately gated; bundle inclusion is optional context only (deferred); no approval / execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; intent:go deferred. First implementation: TaskContextReport Workflow Guide / Agent Instructions. See [`task-context-report-workflow-integration-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-workflow-integration-decision.md).

> Update (slice 180 · TaskContextReport Workflow Guide / Agent Instructions): the context-first workflow is now documented for humans and agents. The canonical pre-work sequence is `rekon scan` → `rekon capability graph build` → `rekon context task` → `rekon artifacts latest --type TaskContextReport --id-only` → `rekon intent assess` / `rekon intent plan review --task-context-ref`. Humans read the TaskContextReport markdown before editing; agents consume `agentContext` before editing; TaskContextReport stays context, not proof — no approval / execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; consumption stays explicit; prepare / approve / status / handoff stay separately gated; intent:go deferred. See [`task-context-workflow.md`](../guides/task-context-workflow.md).

> Update (slice 181 · TaskContextReport Workflow Guide Safety Review): the slice-180 workflow guide + agent instructions were reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — docs/product surface only, guidance not automation. Humans read the TaskContextReport markdown before editing; agents consume `agentContext` before editing; every documented command was confirmed against the live CLI. TaskContextReport stays context, not proof — no approval / command execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; consumption stays explicit; prepare / approve / status / handoff stay separately gated; bundle inclusion optional context only; intent:go deferred; the workflow guide introduces no runtime behavior changes. See [`task-context-workflow-guide-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-workflow-guide-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 182 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Decision): intent bundles may carry optional `TaskContextReport` refs as context for agents/operators (Option B + E) — an additive `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` section plus Rekon-side `context/` sidecars, with the Circe handoff schema unchanged in v1. Inclusion is optional, never required; context stays context, not proof — it must not approve plans, satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan gates, change phase gates, execute commands, write source, or run Circe; hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; Circe is not required to know TaskContextReport internals in v1; intent:go deferred. First implementation: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Implementation. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-decision.md).

> Update (slice 183 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Implementation): `rekon intent bundle write` now attaches optional `TaskContextReport` refs via a repeatable `--task-context-ref` (plus bounded lineage discovery from prepared-plan / assessment `inputRefs`) as an additive `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` section (`role: optional-agent-context`, `proof: false`) plus three Rekon-side `context/` sidecars (`task-context.md` / `task-context.agent.json` / `task-context.refs.json`). With no ref the bundle is byte-identical; a missing / wrong-type ref fails cleanly. The Circe handoff projection (`circe/handoff.json` etc.) and the WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase-gate files are unchanged and never carry task context. TaskContextReport may be included in bundles only as optional context, not proof — it must not be required to write an intent bundle, approve plans, satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan or phase gates, execute commands, write source, or run Circe; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch zones remain guidance; Circe handoff JSON is unchanged in v1; intent:go remains deferred. Implements the slice-182 decision (Option B + E). See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-implementation.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-implementation.md).

> Update (slice 184 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Safety Review): the slice-183 bundle-context implementation was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable — optional `TaskContextReport` context in intent bundles holds every boundary. TaskContextReport may be included in bundles only as optional context, not proof, and is not required to write an intent bundle: a bundle with no ref is byte-identical; a bundle with a ref adds only `manifest.context.taskContextReports[]` (`proof: false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) and the `context/` sidecars (`task-context.md` optional guidance not proof, `task-context.agent.json` all-false boundaries, `task-context.refs.json` refs + `proof:false`). The Circe handoff JSON is unchanged in v1; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase gates unchanged; missing + wrong-type refs fail cleanly; lineage discovery stays bounded and optional. No approval / command execution / source write / WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / Circe; verification hints stay hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; intent:go remains deferred. Recommended next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 185 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood): the optional bundle-context sidecars were dogfooded on a realistic operator/agent handoff path (full intent path → `intent bundle write --task-context-ref` → validate). bundle write succeeded; `manifest.context.taskContextReports` (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) was discoverable; the `context/task-context.md` human brief, `context/task-context.agent.json` agent view, and `context/task-context.refs.json` traceability index were all useful; bundle JSON reported the `taskContext` sidecars; the Circe handoff JSON remains unchanged / not dependent on task context; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates unchanged; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred. One narrow human-discoverability gap was fixed: the bundle `README.md` now renders an additive "## Task context" section (guidance, not proof) only when a TaskContextReport is attached. Sidecars are ready for broader handoff use. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-context-dogfood.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-context-dogfood.md).

> Update (slice 186 · TaskContextReport Bundle Context Dogfood Safety Review): the slice-185 dogfood result + the narrow bundle-README discoverability fix were reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable. TaskContextReport bundle context is optional context, not proof; the full bundle-context dogfood path completed successfully; `manifest.context.taskContextReports` was discoverable (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`); the `context/task-context.md` / `.agent.json` / `.refs.json` sidecars were useful to humans, agents, and traceability; the bundle README now points to the sidecars (guidance, not proof) when context is attached and is omitted otherwise; Circe handoff JSON remains unchanged / not dependent on task context; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates unchanged; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred. Bundle context is ready for broader handoff use. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Context Broader Handoff Decision.

> Update (slice 187 · TaskContextReport Bundle Broader Handoff Decision): decided how broader operator/agent handoff workflows should use the optional bundle-context sidecars (Option B — promote them in human/agent handoff guidance, recommended not required). Humans should inspect `context/task-context.md` when present; agents should read `context/task-context.agent.json` when present; the follow-up will point `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md` (and optionally `agent/context.json` metadata) at the sidecars. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof — must not be required to write an intent bundle, approve plans, execute commands, write source, or satisfy WorkOrder/VerificationPlan or phase gates; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch zones remain guidance; Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract and is not required to understand TaskContextReport internals; intent:go remains deferred. First implementation: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Implementation. See [`task-context-report-bundle-broader-handoff-decision.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-broader-handoff-decision.md).

> Update (slice 188 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Implementation): when a `TaskContextReport` is attached to an intent plan bundle, the agent-facing bundle files now promote the optional context sidecars. `agent/instructions.md` and `agent/handoff.md` gain a "## Task context" section (only when a TaskContextReport is attached) pointing at `context/task-context.agent.json` / `context/task-context.md`, framing context as not-proof and keeping WorkOrder / VerificationPlan / phase gates authoritative; `agent/context.json` gains an additive `taskContext` metadata block (`available:true`, `proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) with every existing field preserved. With no task context the agent files are byte-identical. The bundle README section, the `context/` sidecars, and the Circe handoff trio are unchanged. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof — humans should inspect context/task-context.md when present; agents should read context/task-context.agent.json when present; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract; intent:go remains deferred. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-implementation.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-implementation.md).

> Update (slice 189 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Guidance Safety Review): the slice-188 agent-facing handoff guidance was reviewed end-to-end and declared safe/stable. TaskContextReport sidecars are optional context, not proof; `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md` promote the optional task context only when sidecars are present; `agent/context.json` carries additive `taskContext` metadata (`proof:false`, `role: optional-agent-context`) when present and preserves every existing field; without-context bundles are byte-identical. Agents should read `context/task-context.agent.json` when present; humans should inspect `context/task-context.md` when present; verification hints remain hints; do-not-touch stays guidance; WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates remain authoritative; the Circe handoff JSON remains the machine handoff contract and is not required to understand TaskContextReport internals; sidecars must not approve plans, execute commands, or write source; intent:go remains deferred. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-safety-review.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-guidance-safety-review.md).

> Update (slice 190 · TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood — rebased on 4cc34b73 Circe actor contracts): the promoted handoff guidance was re-dogfooded from both the human-operator and the agent perspective against the current bundle producer after `4cc34b73` ("feat: emit target-specific Circe actor contracts"). A human can discover task context from `README.md`; `context/task-context.md` + `context/task-context.refs.json` were useful; an agent can discover it from `agent/instructions.md` + `agent/handoff.md`; `agent/context.json` `taskContext` metadata + `context/task-context.agent.json` were useful; `agent/verification.json` stayed authoritative for verification posture and `agent/source-refs.json` for source refs. The Circe handoff trio stayed stable and independent of TaskContextReport — `circe/handoff.json` now carries an additive `actorContracts` block. The new `circe/actor-contracts/` artifacts (3 contract Markdown + 3 JSON Schema, default `circe` target) were present and non-executing (return-shape guidance/artifacts, not executed workers) and identical in the without-context bundle. WorkOrder / VerificationPlan + phase gates remained authoritative; source + plan unchanged; no commands executed; no VerificationRun/VerificationResult; Rekon did not run Circe; intent:go remains deferred; the without-context bundle omitted every task-context surface. No fix needed. Next: TaskContextReport Bundle Handoff Dogfood Safety Review. See [`task-context-report-bundle-handoff-dogfood.md`](../strategy/task-context-report-bundle-handoff-dogfood.md).
